This module is based very heavily off of [gpbl/react-day-picker](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker) ([docs and examples](http://www.gpbl.org/react-day-picker/)).
* select weekdays with CSS modifiers
* easily change style and add content to weekday cells
* ready for i18n, with [moment.js](http://momentjs.com) or any other library

### Usage

```bash
npm install react-weekday-picker --save
```

```js 
import React from "react";
import WeekdayPicker from "react-weekday-picker";

class MyComponent extends React.Component {

  render() {
    var modifiers = {
      'weekend': function(weekday) {
        return weekday == 0 || weekday == 6;
      }
    };
  
    return <WeekdayPicker modifiers={modifiers} />
  }
}
```
